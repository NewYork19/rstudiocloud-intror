1.Shared / cloud coding environment
2. Source control - track cahneges and why we changed things - Github is what we are using. Also Gitlab. Issues used similar to Trello - organise as project boards. The manage section can also be chnaged re: privacy settings.
3. Reproducible research via literate programming
4. R
  + Packages
  + Functions (tidyverse)
  + Data Types
  + Objects; Vectors; Matrices; Dataframes (mixed data)
  + Tidyverse paradigm
  + Logic Constructs

#Filter Excercises
#Write a filter that gets all action movies from the movies dataset via the ggplot2movies package
#Write a filter that removes films lasting more than 6 hours from the movies dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2movies)

ggplot2movies::movies

# filter to all action movies
movies %>% 
filter(Action == 1) 

#remove films longer than 6 hours in minutes - Exclude
movies %>% 
  filter(length <= 6*60) %>%  # 6 hours in minutes
  summarise(max (length))  
  
#no genres flagged
movies %>% 
  filter_at(vars(Action:Short), all_vars( . ==0)
```

##Filtering or Selecting Columns
```{r}
iris %>% 
  select(Sepal.Length, Species)

iris %>% 
  select(Sepal.Length, -Species)

iris %>% 
  select(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width)

iris %>% 
  select(starts_with("Sepal"))
#select used for column names

iris %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
prcomp()

#Exercise 21.5

movies %>% 
 rename(budget_if_known = budget) -> movies_cleaned

movies %>% 
  select(budget_if_known = budget, everything())


iris %>% 
  filter(Species=="setosa") %>% 
  select(starts_with("Sepal"))
```
##Cahnging or adding columns
```{r}
iris %>% 
  mutate(Sepal.Length - 0.1, 
        Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)
```
```{r}

```
##Afternoon session
>knitr::purl("1stlinesofrcode.R")


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
iris %>% 
  mutate(Sepal.Length = Sepal.Length -0.1, Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width, Species_trun = str_trunc(as.character(Species), 3), Diff.Sepal.Length = (Sepal.Length - mean(Sepal.Length))/mean(Sepal.Length))

#Add a column to movies that says how much the length differs from the median
movies %>% 
  mutate(diff_length = length - median(length)) -> movies_diff
```
##Aggregating the data [Aggregation=Summary]
- groups = group by
- aggregation = summarise
```{r}
iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),  avg.Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length))

iris %>% 
   group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise_all((mean))

iris %>% 
  mutate(Diff.Sepal.Length = mean(Sepal.Length)) %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>%  
  mutate(Species.Diff.Sepal.Length = (Sepal.Length - mean(Sepal.Length))/mean(Sepal.Length)) 
```
##Exercise
Find the min and max values for length in movies
In a pipeline, find out what proportion of films are Action Comedies, Comedies and neither Action or Comedies

```{r}
#lengthe range
movies %>% 
  summarise(min(length) / max(length)/60)
#proportion by genre
movies %>% 
  group_by(Action, Comedy) %>%   
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(per=n/sum(n))
```





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
